# PlatinumEdge Analytics - Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in PlatinumEdge Analytics to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure operations.

## Authentication & Session Management

### Strong Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters length
- Must contain: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character
- Maximum 128 characters to prevent DoS attacks
- Validation on both frontend and backend
- Real-time password strength feedback

### Session Security
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Unique JWT ID (jti) to prevent token reuse
- Secure token storage in localStorage (HTTPS only in production)
- Automatic token validation and refresh
- Session cleanup on logout
- Protection against session fixation attacks

### Login Persistence & Route Protection
- Persistent authentication across browser refreshes
- Protected routes that require authentication
- Public routes only accessible when not authenticated
- Automatic redirects based on authentication state
- Role-based access control for admin features

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Frontend Validation
- Zod schema validation for all forms
- Real-time input sanitization
- Password strength checking with visual feedback
- Email format validation
- Username pattern validation (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)

### Backend Validation
- Server-side input sanitization for all requests
- XSS prevention through HTML tag removal
- JavaScript injection prevention
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- Input length limitations to prevent buffer overflow

### Sanitization Functions
- Removes HTML tags (`<>`)
- Strips JavaScript protocols
- Removes event handlers (`on*=`)
- Trims whitespace
- Enforces maximum input lengths

## Rate Limiting

### Authentication Endpoints
- **Login/Register**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour per IP
- **Forgot Password**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP

### General API Endpoints
- **Standard API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Admin API**: 50 requests per 15 minutes per IP

### Rate Limiting Features
- Bypass successful requests for auth endpoints
- Standard HTTP headers for rate limit status
- Meaningful error messages with retry timeframes
- IP-based tracking with sliding window

## Security Headers

### Implemented Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Referrer control
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - HSTS for HTTPS (production only)

### Content Security Policy
- **Development**: Relaxed CSP for hot reloading
- **Production**: Strict CSP with 'strict-dynamic'
- Prevents inline script execution
- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources

## HTTPS & Cookie Security

### HTTPS Configuration
- Automatic HTTPS redirect in production
- HSTS header for force HTTPS
- Secure cookie flag enabled in production
- Protection against protocol downgrade attacks

### Cookie Security
- `HttpOnly` flag prevents JavaScript access
- `Secure` flag for HTTPS-only transmission
- `SameSite: lax` protection against CSRF
- Configurable based on environment

## Human Verification

### reCAPTCHA Integration
- reCAPTCHA v2 for registration forms
- Backend validation (development bypass available)
- Protection against bot registrations
- Graceful fallback for demo environments

## Password Security

### Hashing & Storage
- bcrypt with salt for password hashing
- No plaintext password storage
- Secure password reset tokens with expiration
- Protection against rainbow table attacks

### Password Policies
- Prevents common password patterns
- Blocks dictionary words and common combinations
- Enforces character variety requirements
- Length restrictions to prevent DoS

## Database Security

### Query Protection
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Drizzle ORM provides additional SQL safety
- Input validation before database operations
- Connection pooling with secure configurations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data filtering in API responses
- Password hashes never exposed in responses
- JWT secrets stored in environment variables
- Database credentials secured via environment

## Error Handling & Logging

### Secure Error Messages
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)
- No stack traces exposed to clients
- Rate limiting on authentication failures

### Audit Logging
- User authentication events
- Admin actions with timestamps
- Security-related activities
- IP address and user agent tracking

## Environment Configuration

### Production Security
- Environment-specific security settings
- Strict CSP and HTTPS enforcement
- Enhanced rate limiting
- Secure cookie configuration

### Development Security
- Relaxed policies for development productivity
- Security warnings for missing configurations
- Demo mode bypasses for testing
- Comprehensive security logging

## Deployment Security

### Server Configuration
- Security middleware applied before all routes
- Input validation on all requests
- Automatic security header injection
- Environment-based security scaling

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Rate limiting violations logged
- Authentication failure tracking
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Performance impact monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security
- Input validation at multiple layers
- Output encoding for XSS prevention
- Secure random token generation
- Regular security dependency updates

### Operational Security
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Environment variable protection
- Secure deployment practices

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- User data minimization
- Secure data transmission
- Right to data deletion
- Privacy-focused logging

### Industry Standards
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- Security headers best practices
- Authentication standard compliance
- Session management standards

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Advanced bot detection
- Geographic access controls
- Enhanced audit logging
- Automated security scanning

### Monitoring Enhancements
- Real-time security dashboards
- Automated threat detection
- Security incident response
- Performance impact analysis
