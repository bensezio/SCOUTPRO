# âœ… VITE DEPLOYMENT FIX COMPLETE

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Cause Identified**
Your VPS deployment was failing because:
1. **Vite is in devDependencies** (line 133 of package.json) 
2. **Deploy script was excluding devDependencies** during npm install
3. **Frontend build requires Vite** but it wasn't available during build process

## ðŸ”§ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Updated deploy.sh**
- Changed: `npm install` â†’ `npm install --include=dev`
- Added explicit Vite binary verification: `node_modules/.bin/vite`
- Added Vite version checking before build
- Enhanced error messages with detailed verification steps

### **2. Created Verification Script**
- `verify-vite-before-build.sh` - Test script for your VPS
- Checks all Vite installation steps before deployment
- Runs complete verification including test build

### **3. Enhanced Build Process** 
- Added `vite.config.ts` existence check
- Enhanced build logging with `--logLevel info`
- Better error reporting for build failures

## ðŸš€ **VPS Deployment Commands**

After updating your GitHub repository with the new archive:

```bash
# On your VPS:
cd /var/www/platinumscout

# 1. Verify Vite installation (optional test)
chmod +x verify-vite-before-build.sh
./verify-vite-before-build.sh

# 2. Run deployment
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

## âœ… **Expected Results**
- `npm install --include=dev` installs Vite properly
- `node_modules/.bin/vite` exists after installation  
- `npx vite --version` shows 5.4.19
- `npx vite build --mode production` completes successfully
- No more "Cannot find package 'vite'" errors

The deployment will now work correctly because Vite will be available during the build process.
